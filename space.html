            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. It's a rocky world with
                extreme temperature variations, ranging from scorching hot days to freezing cold nights. Despite its
                proximity to the Sun, Mercury has patches of ice in permanently shadowed craters near its poles.</p>

            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <p>Venus is Earth's sister planet, similar in size and composition, but with a thick atmosphere of carbon
                dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures
                hot enough to melt lead. Its surface is obscured by dense clouds, making it difficult to observe its
                geological features.</p>

            <p>Earth is our home planet, the third from the Sun, and the only known world to support life. With its
                moderate temperatures, liquid water, and protective atmosphere, Earth is teeming with diverse
                ecosystems. It's the only planet where we've found evidence of life, from the depths of the ocean to the
                highest mountains.</p>

            <p>Mars, the Red Planet, has polar ice caps, seasons, and a thin atmosphere. Its surface features include
                vast deserts, towering volcanoes, and deep canyons. Mars has captured the imagination of humans for
                centuries, with missions continually exploring its surface in search of signs of past or present life.

            <h2>Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet, a gas giant with colorful bands of clouds and the Great Red Spot. It has a
                strong magnetic field and dozens of moons, including the four Galilean moons. Jupiter's immense size and
                gravitational influence have a significant impact on the dynamics of our solar system, shaping the
                orbits of nearby planets and asteroids.</p>

            <p>Saturn is known for its stunning ring system made of ice and rock particles. It's the second-largest
                planet and has a diverse collection of moons, including Titan, the only moon with a substantial
                atmosphere. Saturn's rings are composed of countless individual ringlets, each orbiting the planet in a
                delicate balance of gravity and momentum.</p>

            <p>Uranus is an ice giant planet with a unique feature â€“ it rotates on its side. It has a faint ring system and a collection of moons, including Miranda. Uranus's unusual axial tilt is thought to be the result of a cataclysmic collision early in its history, giving it a distinctly tilted appearance compared to other planets.</p>

            <p>Neptune is an ice giant with a striking blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. It has strong winds and the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Neptune's atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a vivid blue hue when viewed from space.</p>
