            <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting closest to the Sun. Named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury is a rocky world with a heavily cratered surface, similar in appearance to our Moon. It has extreme temperature variations, ranging from scorching hot temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) during the day to freezing cold temperatures at night. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has patches of ice in permanently shadowed craters near its poles. With no atmosphere to trap heat, it experiences the most substantial temperature differences of any planet in our solar system. Mercury's surface features include vast plains, rugged mountains, and deep craters, providing insights into the planet's geological history.</p>

            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Venus is often called Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and composition, but that's where the similarities end. Venus has a thick atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid that completely shroud its surface. These clouds reflect sunlight, giving Venus its brilliant appearance in the sky. Despite being the second planet from the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures that can exceed 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius). Its extreme greenhouse effect traps heat, making it hotter than Mercury, even though it's farther from the Sun. Venus's surface is dominated by vast volcanic plains, towering mountains, and deep valleys, sculpted by volcanic activity and tectonic forces.</p>

            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to support life. With its moderate temperatures, liquid water, and protective atmosphere, Earth is teeming with diverse ecosystems and abundant life forms. Its atmosphere is composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, creating a protective shield against harmful solar radiation and regulating the planet's climate. Earth's surface features vast oceans, towering mountains, sprawling forests, and expansive deserts, offering a rich tapestry of habitats for a myriad of plant and animal species. From the depths of the ocean to the heights of the mountains, Earth's biosphere showcases the remarkable diversity and resilience of life on our planet.</p>

            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Mars, often called the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun and shares many similarities with Earth. It has polar ice caps, seasons, and a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide. Mars has fascinated scientists and astronomers for centuries, with its potential to harbor past or present life capturing the imagination of explorers and researchers alike. Its surface features include vast deserts, towering volcanoes, and deep canyons, including Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the solar system. Mars is home to the largest volcano, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris, in the solar system. Over the years, numerous missions have explored Mars, seeking to uncover its secrets and pave the way for future human exploration.</p>

            <img src="img/jupers.png" onclick="zoom(jupiter)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It's known for its striking bands of clouds and the iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter's atmosphere is marked by swirling clouds of different colors, created by complex interactions between atmospheric gases and winds. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and dozens of moons, including the four largest moons known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are fascinating worlds in their own right, with diverse geology and potential habitats for life. Jupiter's immense size and gravitational influence play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of our solar system, influencing the orbits of nearby planets and asteroids.</p>

        <div class="planet" id="saturn">
            <img src="img/saturn.png" onclick="zoom(saturn)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, which consists of thousands of individual ringlets made of ice and rock particles. It's the second-largest planet in our solar system and also a gas giant like Jupiter. Saturn has a relatively low density, which means it would float if you could find a bathtub big enough! The planet's rings are a fascinating feature that continues to captivate astronomers and space enthusiasts alike. Beyond its rings, Saturn has a diverse collection of moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system and the only moon with a substantial atmosphere. Titan's thick atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes make it one of the most intriguing destinations for future exploration.</p>

        <div class="planet" id="uranus">
            <img src="img/uranus.png" onclick="zoom(uranus)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Uranus is an ice giant planet located farthest from the Sun among the gas giants. It has a unique feature among the planets in our solar system â€“ it rotates on its side, likely due to a massive collision in its early history. Uranus has a faint ring system and a collection of moons, the largest of which is named Miranda. Despite being discovered over two centuries ago, Uranus remains one of the least explored planets in our solar system, with only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, having flown by the planet in 1986. Its extreme axial tilt and unusual magnetic field make Uranus a fascinating object of study for astronomers seeking to unlock the mysteries of our solar system's outer reaches.</p>

            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, and it's another ice giant similar to Uranus. It has a striking blue coloration due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Neptune is known for its strong winds and the Great Dark Spot, a storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Like Uranus, Neptune also has a faint ring system and a diverse array of moons, including Triton, which is believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object. Triton's retrograde orbit and unusual geological features make it one of the most intriguing moons in our solar system, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of planetary formation and evolution.</p>
