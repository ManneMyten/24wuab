            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. It's a rocky world with a
                surface that is heavily cratered, resembling our Moon. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury
                experiences extreme temperature variations, with scorching hot temperatures during the day and freezing
                cold temperatures at night. It has no atmosphere to trap heat, making it one of the hottest planets in
                our solar system.</p>

        <div class="planet" id="venus">
            <img src="img/venus.png" onclick="zoom(venus)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Venus is often called Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and composition. However, it has a
                thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid that completely shroud
                its surface, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. Surface temperatures on Venus can reach
                up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius), hot enough to melt lead. Despite its harsh
                conditions, Venus has intrigued scientists for centuries, and missions continue to study its mysterious
                atmosphere and surface.</p>

            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. With its unique blend
                of atmosphere, water, and moderate temperatures, Earth is teeming with diverse ecosystems and abundant
                life forms. It's also the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on its surface, essential
                for supporting life as we know it. Earth's atmosphere protects it from harmful solar radiation and
                regulates its climate, making it a truly remarkable oasis in the vastness of space.</p>

        <div class="planet" id="mars">
            <img src="img/mars3.png" onclick="zoom(mars)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Mars, often called the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun and shares many similarities with
                Earth. It has polar ice caps, seasons, and a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide. Mars is
                home to the largest volcano in our solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris.
                Over the years, Mars has captured the imagination of scientists and space enthusiasts alike, with
                numerous missions exploring its surface in search of signs of past or present life.</p>

        <div class="planet" id="jupiter">
            <img src="img/jupers.png" onclick="zoom(jupiter)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.
                It's known for its striking bands of clouds and the iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been
                raging for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and dozens of moons, including the four
                largest moons known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiter's immense size
                and gravitational influence play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of our solar system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="planet" id="saturn">
            <img src="img/saturn.png" onclick="zoom(saturn)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, which consists of thousands of individual ringlets made of
                ice and rock particles. It's the second-largest planet in our solar system and also a gas giant like
                Jupiter. Saturn has a relatively low density, which means it would float in water if you could find a
                bathtub big enough! The planet's rings are a fascinating feature that continues to captivate astronomers
                and space enthusiasts alike.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="planet" id="uranus">
            <img src="img/uranus.png" onclick="zoom(uranus)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Uranus is an ice giant planet located farthest from the Sun among the gas giants. It has a unique feature
                among the planets in our solar system â€“ it rotates on its side, likely due to a massive collision in its
                early history. Uranus has a faint ring system and a collection of moons, the largest of which is named
                Miranda. Despite being discovered over two centuries ago, Uranus remains one of the least explored
                planets in our solar system.</p>

        <div class="planet" id="neptune">
            <img src="img/Neptune.png" onclick="zoom(neptune)">
            <div class="orbit"></div>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, and it's another ice giant similar to Uranus. It
                has a striking blue coloration due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Neptune is known for
                its strong winds and the Great Dark Spot, a storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Like
                Uranus, Neptune also has a faint ring system and a diverse array of moons, including Triton, which is
                believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object.</p>
